<h1>My First Post</h1>

<p>First I have to complain about my windows 10 software! So for the 4 days It's been stuck in a funky automatic software boot, but never actually reboots</p>
<p>Is this a problem when trying to code and your computer just starts to reboot on its own?</p>
<h2>YES</h2>
<I managed to disable it once but it has appeared once again.</p>
<p>So the end result, I just ordered a Macbook Pro and hopefully it will be here on Saturday</p>
<p>Thank You Microsoft!</p>
<p>Looking forward to coding on a new laptop, and hopefully starting a new career soon.</p>
